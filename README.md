## Functionalities

- **Data Visualization**: The application fetches trivia questions and displays the data in two interactive bar charts: one for question categories and one for question difficulty.
- **Interactive Filtering**: Users can filter the difficulty chart by clicking on a category in the category chart or by selecting a category from the list. This allows for a more detailed view of the data.
- **Dark/Light Theme**: The application supports both dark and light themes, which can be toggled by the user.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is designed to be responsive and work on different screen sizes.
